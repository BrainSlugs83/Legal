- Here's the deal, folks: 

  - I have no intention of collecting, storing, or selling any of your personal data.  I just want to make awesome games that are fun and make people happy. 🙂

  - However, I don't have any lawyers, I'm an individual, and I have no idea what I'm doing.  In the event that something bad does happen, **I TAKE NO RESPONSIBILITY**.  I'll do my best to operate in good faith of course, and take preacutions I deem necessary to protect you, but that's not a guarantee, or any kind of legal commitment.
  
  - If you're not cool with that, then please don't play my games. 🤷🏻‍♂️
